# Ski-Lift
We have seen long lift lines at ski resorts. The ski-lift waiting time is one of the main indicators to evaluate a ski area. Lift capacity and the frequency of its arrival define the dynamic capacity of the ski lift.

Mountain geographical data, skier arrival pattern, slopes, skier categories, demographic distribution, and chairlift characteristic are used to build mathematical and simulation models to determine the type, the number, and the
layout of lifts that will minimize wait times and reduce development and operation cost of the ski resort.

Herein, I develop a simple queueing model. Because the model is simple, I get exact answers. I also simulate the model, which is beneficial when the model gets more complex. Finally, I discuss the necessary next steps that will lead to a decision.

The tool is a R shiny application.
